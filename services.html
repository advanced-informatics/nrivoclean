          <h3>Fascia &amp; Soffit Cleaning</h3>
          <p>Fascia boards and soffits are exposed to the elements year-round, leading to the build-up of green algae, black streaks, cobwebs and general weathering. Left untreated, this can make even a well-maintained home look neglected.</p>
          <p>We clean and restore fascia boards and soffits to their original condition, enhancing your property's overall appearance.</p>
          <ul>
